abstract = "Nowadays video technology is basically digital, but in the last half century the most diffused devices have been analog magnetic tapes. Since this is an old storing technique, it is necessary to convert these data in digital form. Moreover, analog videos may be affected by particular defects, called drops. Despite there are many hardware to perform the digitalization, few implement the correction of drops. In this paper, the drop also known as “Mistracking” is focused. A method to detect and correct this artifact is developed."
