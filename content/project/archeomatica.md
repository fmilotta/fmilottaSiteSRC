**Abstract:** "Archeomatica", when Archaeology meets Informatics. Digital Archaeology employed to preserve our Cultural Heritage through 3D modeling, digital restoration, 3D-scan, augmented reality, color specification, shape-recognition, virtual tour, digitization of textual archives, and thin sections.

Reconstructing the human presence in historical settings has recently become the aim of several scientific co-operations between archaeological and computer science personnel. In particular, computer graphics help researchers to reconstruct original locations starting from a simple plan. Digital Archaeology therefore improves the quality of the data available in classical archaeology. 3D modelling allows some of the most important buildings of the classical or near-eastern cultures to be reconstructed in order to diffuse knowledge about this world. Despite a certain level of success, the reconstructions made to date have not been very detailed, and are usually inaccurate. In the last few years, several research projects have begun in order to provide optimal reconstructions that include all the data sets from the excavations. The basic idea is that archaeological 3D modelling adds the possibility of creating virtual reconstructions to the usual graphic and photographic documentation. These reconstructions help to show how the place originally looked.

In 2007 the [Image Processing Lab @ UNICT](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/) started out a digital archaeology research program named **Archeomatica Project**, aimed to produce 3D models of prehistoric archaeological sites with a high level of accuracy, following the data gained during the excavations. From that point, the project is grown a lot. Nowaday, several topics are treated within the project, as digital restoration, 3D-scan, augmented reality, color specification, shape-recognition, virtual tour, digitization of textual archives, and thin sections.

The Archeomatica Project is ready to answer the call for digitization of Cultural Heritage and creation of new interactive services for visitors and scholars.
