abstract = "3D scanning has gone a long way since its first appearance in cultural heritage digitization and modeling. In the recent years some new low cost, fast, accurate emerging technologies are flooding the market. Envisioning the massive use of these cheap and easy to use devices in the next years, it is crucial to explore the possible fields of application and to test their effectiveness in terms of easiness of 3D data collection, processing, mesh resolution and metric accuracy against the size and features of the objects. In this study we focus the attention on one emerging technology, the Structure Sensor device, in order to verify a 3D pipeline acquisition on an architectural element and its details. The methodological approach is thought to define a pipeline of 3D acquisition exploiting low cost and open source technologies and foresees the assessment of this procedure in comparison with data obtained by a Time of Flight device."
