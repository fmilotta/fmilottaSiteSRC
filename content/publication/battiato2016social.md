abstract = "We present The Social Picture, a framework to collect and explore huge amount of crowdsourced social images about public events, cultural sites and other customized private events.The Social Picture aims to create social communities of users that contribute to the creation of image collections of common interests. The collections can be explored through a number of advanced Computer Vision algorithms, able to capture the visual content of images in order to organize them in a semantic way. The interfaces available in The Social Picture allow the users to create customized collections by exploiting semantic filters based on visual features, social tags, geolocation, and other information."
