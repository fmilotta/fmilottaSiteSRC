abstract = "The Morgantina silver Treasure belonging to the collections of the Archaeological Museum of Aidone (Sicily) were involved in a 3D survey and diagnostics campaign for monitoring over time of the finds, in anticipation of their temporary transfer to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, for a period of four years. According to a multidisciplinary approach, it has been developed a scientific and methodological protocol based on non-invasive techniques to achieve a complete and integrated knowledge of the precious items, of their conservation state and increasing their valorisation. All acquired data, i.e. 3D models, UV fluorescence and X-Ray images and chemical information, will be made available, in a integrated way, within a web oriented platform, that will represent a in progress tool to deepen the existing archaeological knowledge and technologies of production and to obtain referenced information of the state of preservation, before and after moving of the finds from their exposure site."
